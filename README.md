# python_options_analytics_qtapp

## File Structure
This is an application I made to practice a bit on my understanding of the black-scholes formulas.  There are 3 useful python files in this folder.  One is black-scholes.py that establishes the entire computational system on the black-scholes equation and their derived equations.  The other one is the binomial.py that uses the binomial tree to build out the program.  Due to there similarity, from now on these 2 files are going to be collectively called the Computations Files  The qt_options_tracker.py is the qt gui wrapper that presents the calculations in an ugly way.

## Brief Explanation of the Computations Files
All of the Computations Files will follow this format.  We define a few functions that would be used in the gui wrapper.  In order, these are, OptionsVal (to determine the value of an option at any specified parameter), ThreadWithReturnValue (a class to help with running the threading module of python with return values), plgraph (which generates the plgraph of an option with the parameter being a dictionary that is called config, see later), legn (a subfunction under plgraph that calculates for a specific leg of option specified in config the profit of an option), legstock (a subfunction under plgraph that calculates for a specific leg of stock that is within the option strategy specified in config the profit of a stock), plpoint (a pl of the specified strategy under a specfic set of parameters), bepoint(the breakeven point at expiration of the specified strategy), delta, gamma, theta, vega, cdf (cumulative distribution function of a lognormal distribution), pdf (probability density function of a lognormal distribution)
